# Notes for GVH7074

https://github.com/w1gx/govee-ble-scanner/wiki/Sniffing-BLE-advertising-packets was helpful in decoding the GVH5074

## Flags
`02 01 06`

`02` - two bytes 

`01` - Type = Flags 

`06` - Value (bitwise - 00000110) Bit 1 : "LE General Discoverable Mode", Bit 2: "BR/EDR Not Supported."

## Service Class
`07 03 0A 18 F5 FE 88 EC`

`07` - 7 bytes 

`03` - Type = Service Class 

`0A 18` -> 18 0A (little endian) - Device Information 

`F5 FE` -> FE F5 (little endian) - Dialog Semiconductor GmbH

`88 EC` -> EC 88 (little endian) - unknown

## Complete Local Name
`11 09 47 6F 76 65 65 5F 48 35 30 37 34 5F 41 41 41 41`

`11` - 17 bytes 

`09` - Type = Complete Local Name 

`47 6F 76 65 65 5F 48 35 30 37 34 5F 41 41 41 41` = Govee_H5074_AAAA (AAAA = last 4 of mac)

## Manufacturer Specific Data
`0A FF 88 EC 00 65 07 75 12 64 02`

`0A` - 10 bytes 

`FF` - Type = Manufacturer Specific Data 

`88 EC 00` - unknown - same across all 'p' strings 

`65 07` -> `07 65` (little endian) = See notes on [temperature](#temperature) below

`75 12` -> `12 75` (little endian) = 4725 in decimal. Divide by 100 to get relative humidity 

`64` - 100 in decimal. Assuming this is battery percentage, but not sure. 

`02` - unknown 

## Temperature
The GVH5074 uses [Two's Complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement#Converting_to_two's_complement_representation) for negative numbers.
> In two's complement notation, a non-negative number is represented by its ordinary binary representation; in this case, the most significant bit is 0. Though, the range of numbers represented is not the same as with unsigned binary numbers. For example, an 8-bit unsigned number can represent the values 0 to 255 (11111111). However a two's complement 8-bit number can only represent positive integers from 0 to 127 (01111111), because the rest of the bit combinations with the most significant bit as '1' represent the negative integers −1 to −128.
> 
> The two's complement operation is the additive inverse operation, so negative numbers are represented by the two's complement of the absolute value.

The berry language has a `geti` [method](https://github.com/berry-lang/berry/wiki/Chapter-7#get-geti-methods) that will return a signed value.

> Read a 1/2/4 bytes value from any offset in the bytes array. The standard mode is little endian, if you specify a negative size it enables big endian. `get` returns unsigned values, while `geti` returns signed values.
> `b.geti(<offset>, <size>) -> bytes object`

In order to get the temperature in °C, use the `geti` method and then divide by 100.0
```
# Example
adv_data = bytes('88EC0052FA6E166402')
temp = adv_data.geti(3,2) / 100.0
```
Output 
```
-14.54
```
