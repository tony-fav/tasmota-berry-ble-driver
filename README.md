# Blerry - BLE Driver for Tasmota written in Berry

Requires a build with BLE and Berry (ESP32 devices only).

To use: 
- Upload `blerry.be`, `blerry_main.be`, and each `blerry_model_xxxx.be` model driver file you may need to the file system of the ESP32.
- Edit `blerry.be` as needed for your device configuration, HA discovery choices, etc...
- Create and enable (`Rule1 1`) the following Tasmota Rule and Restart Tasmota (Some of the commands used in `blerry.be` are not initialized by the time `autoexec.be` is run. So, you must load `blerry.be` as part of a rule.)
```
Rule1 ON System#Boot DO br load('blerry.be') ENDON
```
